# Route Inventory

The API route inventory is generated from FastAPI route metadata and exposed by `/api/manifest`.

Each route declares:

- `path`
- `method`
- `operation_id`
- `tags`
- `summary`
- `validation_only`
- `side_effect_class`
- `requires_auth_future`
- `blocked_from_production`

Allowed side-effect classes in v0.12.2 are:

- `none`
- `validation_only`
- `local_dev_workspace_only`

Production runtime side effects are not allowed in this milestone.

M8 route group:

- `/model-runtime/manifests/validate`
- `/model-runtime/requests/validate`
- `/model-runtime/responses/validate`
- `/model-runtime/simulate`

These routes validate metadata and produce simulated responses only.

M8.5 approval route group:

- `/approvals/requests/validate`
- `/approvals/grants/validate`
- `/approvals/validate`
- `/approvals/receipts/validate`

These routes validate local/dev approval authority contracts only. They do not provide production auth, OAuth, persistence, or external execution.

Invalid payload responses are sanitized and must not include raw invalid input values.
