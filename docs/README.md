# Ultimate AI Agent Docs

Status: active
Current through: v0.32.0
Purpose: Human-facing entrypoint for active documentation and historical archive navigation.

Active docs are few, indexed, and current. Historical docs are preserved under
`docs/archive/`, clearly treated as audit artifacts, and are not current source
of truth.

Start with:

```text
docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
docs/canonical/09_roadmap.md
docs/canonical/CANONICAL_DOC_MAP.md
docs/roadmap/README.md
docs/archive/README.md
docs/maintenance/DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_POLICY.md
```

Current release packet:

Use active canonical docs and active roadmap docs for current work. Use archive
docs only for historical review. Git tags and release history preserve exact
historical snapshots.

v0.29.5 is documentation policy polish only. It accepts the pushed duplicate
wording cleanup from `374bb1e` and remains the cleanup baseline before M26.

v0.32.0 implements M28 Approval Authority v2 + Action Policy Expansion as a
policy-only, decision-only contract layer. v0.32.0 adds no backend execution
routes, frontend features, action execution, tool execution, file mutation,
memory writes, network calls, model/provider calls, plugin enablement, browser
automation, mobile/device access, remote execution, shell execution,
dependencies, M29 work, or production authority. M29-M40 remain
planned/provisional.
